# cccfa_website

## Name
ccocean

## Description
The code within this repo is a copy of all code controling the website https://ccocean.whoi.edu/index.html/. This site was built to visualize oceanographic trends around cape cod. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) is involved in a collaboration between the Cape Cod Commercial Fisherman's Alliance (CCCFA) and the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation (CFRF) aimed at taking measurements of water salinity, temperature, and density throughout the water column at various offshore locations. This site was built to showcase these observations and has since evolved to also incoporate satellite imagery. 

## Usage
Code in this repository could be used to create geotiffs of remotely sensed data sets or convert these to tiles for web use. If interested in the accessing the CTD profiles take a look at the ERDAAP_readin files. 

## Support
Reach out at finn.wimberly@whoi.edu with any questions. 

## Roadmap
We are currently in the process of adding another subpage that will highlight seasonal changes in obseved quantities and monthly anomalies.
