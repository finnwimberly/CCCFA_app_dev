## Name
ccocean

## Description
The code within this repo is a copy of all code controling the website https://ccocean.whoi.edu. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) is collaborating with the Cape Cod Commercial Fisherman's Alliance (CCCFA), the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation (CFRF), and NOAA Fisheries' Environmental Monitors on Lobster Traps and Large Trawlers (eMOLT) program to increase the number of salinity, temperature, and density profiles taken throughout the broader Cape Cod ocean. The project aims to offer insight into seasonal shifts in the water column composition in hopes of building knowledge that is useful to both commercial fisherman and scientists. This site was built as a platform to showcase these profiles and has since evolved to include other relevant datasets. 

## Usage
Code in this repository could be used to create geotiffs of remotely sensed data sets or convert these to tiles for web use. If interested in the accessing the CTD profiles take a look at the ERDAAP_readin files. 

## Support
Reach out at finn.wimberly@whoi.edu with any questions. 

## Roadmap
The site has incorporated the majority of functions we plan to include. Development emphasis has shifted to enhancing the user experience. The page is rather functional for computer usage and considerbaly less on mobile devices. Future iterations of the site will be more mobile-friendly.
